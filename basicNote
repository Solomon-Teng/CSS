CSS Typography

you can make changes to a text with text-decoration to like underline, overline, linethrough, 
solid, or none. for an example of the use of none value you can remove the default underline
by the <a href=""> link by using the none value

you can also use text-transform to modify text to make it capitalize, uppercase, lowercase, 
and none for removing any defauly html text-transform to fit your objective.

you can also aligned your text with text-align attribute and values like justify, center, left, 
right, or inherit.

Pseudo-class

Pseudo-class is a sub attribute inside an element. Say we have <a href=""> element and we want to
change attribute inside it in CSS, we can use 

-a:visited
-a:hover
-a:active
shorten for LVHA rule to memorize better

in particular order, note that the order how which comes first is very important otherwise some
pseudo-class might not working.

List Style

we can style list tag like ul or ol with list-style-type.

And we can also control the start order in the ul or ol tag by using start attribute follow by the number order

and we can also use reversed attribute to reverse the order, note that reverse attribute don't need to add value input.

Text-align

now we can align text to the center but in some browser
the list tag is not affected by this. They likely have 
the default setting to set list-style-position: outside;
or something similar, therefore the separation.

So we want to make sure to set the list-style-position
to inside and then it will follow.

and we can use image for our list-style with
list-style-image attribute and fill it with
url("../img/image.png"); 

but note that the image must be small enough to fit in the
list type size for best practice

but if we want better choice, we can do 
list-style: disc url("../img/image.png") inside;
for much effective workflow.
