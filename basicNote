About CSS

we usually link css file to the main html using meta tag of rel attribute and stylesheet value for best practice
  <link rel="stylesheet" href"css/style.css">

we can put it inside the <Style> tag or make it inline like <div style="color: blue;"> but it is advised to separate the css file.

the element we use to style the content is called selector
  body {
    font-family: Arial;
  }

Unit

We want to use certain unit in certain context, we want to use rem (root element) for font-size instead of px
for a responsive web design. Px is an absolute unit so it will not scale along with user browser font-size preference.

and it is considered best practice to use rem for a font-size inside an elements, we can use rem unit inside a button 
with text and scale the padding and padding with em relatively. 

1rem = 16px, 1em = scale relative to the rem unit

however, we can use px unit for other context in a way it wouldn't break the responsiveness of the web page.
We can use px on stuff like border.

And we want to use % instead of vw for things like max-width to avoid those extra space when the scroll bar is shown 

we can use container class to create a well structured design hiearchy. 

html 
<div class="containerParent">
  <div class="containerChild">
    content
  </div>
</div>

css
.containerParent {
  background-color: blue;
}

.containerChile {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
}

we can also use id attribute for css, but instead of .containerParent, we use #containerParent.
but it's not usually advised to use id attribute to avoid clashing with other id name inside the html.
